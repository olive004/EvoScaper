    "\n",
    "Goal\n",
    "1. understand how Hfq competition changes the dynamics of sRNA networks\n",
    "2. is Hfq a limiting factor\n",
    "    - or are there some sRNAs that are more limiting\n",
    "3. which interactions are most sensitive to Hfq\n",
    "4. is activation / repression more sensitive to Hfq limitation\n",
    "5. Hfq binding\n",
    "    - AU binding site prediction\n",
    "    - Can we predict how Hfq is going to bind to an RNA\n",
    "    - can we predict if Hfq is going to recruit RNAse E with an sRNA\n",
    "6. mutational sensitivity\n",
    "    - are there mutations that both disrupt the key AU content and the sRNA functionality\n",
    "    - AU site predi\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations\n",
